# Context Prune Rules

## Keep
- Unresolved questions needed for next execution step
- Active assumptions that still require validation
- Blocking dependencies not yet resolved

## Remove or Move
- Move confirmed decisions to `doc/context-log.md`
- Move unfinished executable tasks to `doc/next-actions.md`
- Remove duplicates, stale guesses, and resolved notes

## Prune Checklist
1. Remove completed or irrelevant temporary notes.
2. Ensure unresolved items are actionable.
3. Confirm inbox is minimal before closing the task.
